# Packetpig Installation Instructions

## Note

I will expand this guide over time starting with Ubuntu and Mac OSX then adding
Centos at some stage in the future.

## Docker Container 

The fastest way to experiment with Packetpig is to clone the Docker container or build it from a Dockerfile.

To clone the container;

    docker pull cloudjunky/packetpig

To fully provision from the Dockerfile. Run this command from the same directory you have the Dockerfile;

    docker build packetpig .

To accomplish the same via a Vagrant image;

    git clone https://github.com/dotcloud/docker.git
    cd docker
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
   
    docker pull cloudjunky/packetpig 
    *or
    docker build packetpig .

Once the container is provisioned you can access it via;

    docker run -i -t packetpig /bin/bash
    cd /src/packetpig

Then run the demo scripts as normal;

    pig -x local -f pig/examples/basic_http.pig -param pcap=data/web.pcap -param output=output

## Ubuntu 11.10 and Cloudera CDH3

Start off with a basic Ubuntu 11.10 32bit or 64bit desktop build. You
can obviously achieve the same results on Ubuntu Server however the
desktop comes pre-installed with an X environment allowing you to view
visualisations in a browser quickly enough.

Some packages in this install are now in the Ubuntu Universe repo. Edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following two lines;

    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe
    deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe

Create a new apt source so that we can leverage the Cloudera
distributions for Hadoop and Pig.

    sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera.list

Add the following lines.

    deb http://archive.cloudera.com/debian maverick-cdh3 contrib
    deb-src http://archive.cloudera.com/debian maverick-cdh3 contrib

And then add the Cloudera key.

    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo curl -s http://archive.cloudera.com/debian/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -

Update the running system

    sudo apt-get update

Install all the required packages for the Packetpig platform and accept
the dependencies.

    sudo apt-get install build-essential hadoop-0.20 hadoop-pig git-core libnids-dev libnids1.21 libmagic-dev ipython python2.6-dev libnet1-dev python-pip flex bison libpcap0.8 libpcap0.8-dev openjdk-6-jdk libpcre3 libpcre3-dev pkg-config gettext

(OPTIONAL) You may also want to install some additional software for the visualisations

    sudo apt-get install chromium-browser r-base r-base-dev

Install the following Python modules.

    sudo pip install python-magic argparse

Then you need to install libdnet, fix libdnet ;), snort, glib, p0f and pynids from source.

    wget http://libdnet.googlecode.com/files/libdnet-1.12.tgz
    tar -zxvf libdnet-1.12.tgz
    cd libdnet-1.12/
    ./configure && make
    sudo make install

Fixing libdnet

    sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libdnet.1.0.1 /usr/local/lib/libdnet.so.1.0.1
    sudo ldconfig
    sudo updatedb

Install DAQ

    wget http://www.snort.org/downloads/1850
    tar -zxvf 1850
    cd daq-1.1.1/
    ./configure && make
    sudo make install

Install Snort

    wget http://www.snort.org/downloads/1862
    tar -zxvf 1862
    cd snort-2.9.3.1/
    ./configure  --prefix /usr/local/snort --enable-ipv6 --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased  --enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling   --enable-zlib --enable-reload
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo groupadd snort
    sudo useradd -g snort snort
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/bin/snort /usr/sbin/
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/etc /etc/snort
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/snort/var/log
    sudo chown snort:snort /usr/local/snort/var/log
    sudo ln â€“s /usr/local/snort/var/log /var/log/snort
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicengine /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicengine
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/lib/snort_dynamicrules /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    sudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/snort
    sudo ldconfig 

Installing the Snort Rules

    Navigate to http://www.snort.org/snort-rules/ and create an account so you can download the "Registered User Release"
    Download "snortrules-snapshot-2931.tar.gz" into ~/src/
    cd /usr/local/snort
    sudo tar -zxvf ~/src/snortrules-snapshot-2931.tar.gz
    [For 32bit systems] sudo cp so_rules/precompiled/Ubuntu-10-4/i386/2.9.3.1/*.so /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules/
    [For 64bit systems] sudo cp so_rules/precompiled/Ubuntu-10-4/x86-64/2.9.3.1/*.so /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules/
    sudo snort -c /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf --dump-dynamic-rules=/usr/local/snort/so_rules
    sudo vi /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf

    Find the Reputation preprocessor section and comment it out;

    # Reputation preprocessor. For more information see README.reputation
    # preprocessor reputation: \
    #   memcap 500, \
    #   priority whitelist, \
    #   nested_ip inner, \
    #   whitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH/white_list.rules, \
    #   blacklist $BLACK_LIST_PATH/black_list.rules

    Find the dynamic library rules section and uncomment all the dynamic rules.
    # dynamic library rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/bad-traffic.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/chat.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/dos.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/exploit.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/icmp.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/imap.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/misc.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/multimedia.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/netbios.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/nntp.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/p2p.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/smtp.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/snmp.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/specific-threats.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-activex.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-client.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-iis.rules
    include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-misc.rules

    Test the configuration
    sudo snort -c /usr/local/snort/etc/snort.conf -T <-- you should see "Snort successfully validated the configuration!"

Install glib

    wget ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.2/glib-2.2.3.tar.bz2
    bunzip2 glib-2.2.3.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf glib-2.2.3.tar
    cd glib-2.2.3
    ./configure && make
    sudo make install

Install p0f

    wget http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/releases/p0f-3.06b.tgz
    tar -zxvf p0f-3.06b.tgz
    cd p0f-3.06b/
    vi config.h and change the define FP_FILE line from "p0f.fp" to "/etc/p0f/p0f.fp"
    make
    sudo cp p0f /usr/local/bin/
    sudo mkdir /etc/p0f
    sudo cp p0f.fp /etc/p0f/

Install pynids
For 32 bit systems

    wget http://jon.oberheide.org/pynids/downloads/pynids-0.6.1.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pynids-0.6.1.tar.gz
    cd pynids-0.6.1
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

For 64bit systems

    wget http://jon.oberheide.org/pynids/downloads/pynids-0.6.1.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pynids-0.6.1.tar.gz
    cd pynids-0.6.1
    tar -zxvf libnids-1.24.tar.gz
    cd libnids-1.24/
    ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC --disable-libglib --disable-libnet --disable-shared && make
    sudo make install
    cd ..
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

(Optional) Once all the packages are installed the R packages for time series and
plotting need to be installed.

    sudo R
    chooseCRANmirror()
    install.packages(c("zoo", "xts","ggplot2"))

Accept all defaults.

Pig and Hadoop require the JAVA_HOME environment variable to be set.

    sudo vi /etc/environment
    #For 32 bit environments
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/
    #For 64 bit environments
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/

Now all the base software is installed we need to install the Packetpig
platform and run some simple tests.

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/packetloop/packetpig.git
    cd packetpig
    lib/scripts/tcp.py -r data/web.pcap -om http_headers -of tsv | less
    lib/scripts/dns_parser.py -r data/web.pcap
    mkdir out
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/snort/ lib/snort
    snort -c lib/snort/etc/snort.conf -A fast -y -l out -r data/web.pcap
    more out/alert <-- will most likely contain no attacks but shows snort is working.

Both tcp.py and dns_parser.py should extract information out of data/web.pcap and display it to the screen. Now you are ready to run some Packetpig queries.

    pig -x local -f pig/examples/binning.pig -param pcap=data/web.pcap -param output=output

This will result in something like this. 

    2012-04-16 16:15:33,970 [main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher - Success!

You can confirm it has worked by.

## Mac OSX 10.7 (Lion)

Before you start you need XCode installed or more specifically the XCode Command Line Tools. Within XCode Preferences there is a "Downloads" menu that allows you to install the command line tools.

The next step is to make sure you have Java installed. I ran this command to check, if it doesn't find Java it prompts you to install it.

    /usr/libexec/java_home --request

After installing it you should set the JAVA_HOME environment variable using something like.

    export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`

The Homebrew package manager allows you to install most of the components required for Packetpig quickly and easily. To install Homebrew run this command.

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"

Once Homebrew is installed run the brew doctor and also the brew update command to make sure you have the latest brews.

    brew doctor
    brew update

After running brew doctor I received a warning "Your Xcode is configured with an invalid path" to fix it I entered

    sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/

Once brew is working correctly you can install the bulk of the requirements for Packetpig.

    brew install git hadoop pig libnids libmagic snort p0f wget

For some of the Python modules you can't use Homebrew so I used the pip package mangaer.

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip insatll ipython
    sudo pip install python-magic

Then lastly you need to install pynids from source.

    sudo pip install http://jon.oberheide.org/pynids/downloads/pynids-0.6.1.tar.gz

A good test to ensure that everything on the Python side is working is to clone the Packetpig repository and run the following commands from within the packetpig directory.

    git clone https://github.com/packetloop/packetpig.git
    cd packetpig
    lib/scripts/tcp.py -r data/web.pcap -om http_headers -of tsv | less
    lib/scripts/dns_parser.py -r data/web.pcap

Both tcp.py and dns_parser.py should extract information out of data/web.pcap and display it to the screen. Now you are ready to run some Packetpig queries.

    pig -x local -f pig/examples/binning.pig -param pcap=data/web.pcap -param output=output

This will result in something like this. 

    2012-04-16 16:15:33,970 [main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.MapReduceLauncher - Success!

You can confirm it has worked by.

    more output/binning/part-r-00000
    1322643600,171738,142808,338610

For some of the visualisations you will want R and RStudio installed. Install the Mac OSX package for R at http://cran.us.r-project.org/ and the RStudio package from http://rstudio.org. Once you have R or RStudio installed you can manually install the 'zoo', 'xts' and 'ggplot2' packages.
